    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 17, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>👋 <strong>Hello there!</strong> We know legal documents can be boring, but we've tried to make these terms as clear and straightforward as possible. This document outlines what you can expect from us and what we expect from you when using LingoLens.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Let's Get Started: Accepting These Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using LingoLens ("our app" or "the Service"), you're agreeing to these terms. It's that simple! If you don't agree with something here, we understand, but you'll need to stop using the app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Using LingoLens</h2>

    <h3>Your License to Use Our App</h3>
    <p>We're granting you a personal license to use LingoLens for your own, non-commercial purposes. Think of it as a library card that lets you access all our cool features, as long as you follow the rules.</p>

    <h3>A Few Ground Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Please use the app legally (we're sure you would anyway!)</li>
      <li>Don't try to reverse engineer or modify the app</li>
      <li>Don't intentionally overload or hack our service</li>
      <li>No bots or automated access, please—our app is designed for humans</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Free vs Premium: Our Subscription Options</h2>

    <h3>What's Included</h3>
    <p>LingoLens offers both free and premium features. Our premium subscription unlocks offline access, removes ads, and provides additional learning tools to enhance your language journey.</p>

    <h3>How Subscriptions Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose from weekly, monthly, or yearly plans</li>
      <li>Payment happens through your Google Play account</li>
      <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, we can't offer refunds for partial subscription periods</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Free Trials</h3>
    <p>When we offer free trials, they'll automatically convert to a paid subscription when the trial period ends. If you'd rather not continue, just cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends. No hard feelings!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ownership & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, features, and trademarks in LingoLens belong to the GTTM Team. While you're welcome to use them within the app, please don't use our content elsewhere without permission.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Your Content</h2>
    <p>You own the content you create in LingoLens. By using our app, you're giving us permission to use your content to improve our services and help other users learn. Don't worry—we'll never share your personal information alongside your content.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>LingoLens might link to other services or content we don't own. While we try to keep good company, we can't take responsibility for what these third parties do or say.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Legal Stuff We Need to Say</h2>

    <h3>As-Is Service</h3>
    <p>LingoLens is provided "as is" without warranties about accuracy or availability. We work hard to make it great, but we can't guarantee it'll be perfect 100% of the time.</p>

    <h3>Liability Limitations</h3>
    <p>We're not liable for indirect damages resulting from your use of LingoLens. In plain English: we've built the best app we can, but unforeseen things happen in technology.</p>

    <h3>Your Legal Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>You agree to defend and hold the GTTM Team harmless from claims related to how you use LingoLens. Think of it this way: you're responsible for what you do with our tool.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction, without triggering any legal conflicts between different systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. When you continue using LingoLens after an update, you're saying "I agree" to the new version. We'll try to let you know about significant changes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Account Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to LingoLens, especially if these Terms are violated. We don't make these decisions lightly, but sometimes it's necessary to protect our community and service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Questions? We're Here to Help</h2>
    <p>If anything in these Terms seems unclear or you have other questions, we'd love to hear from you: <a href="mailto:support@lingolens.app">support@lingolens.app</a></p>

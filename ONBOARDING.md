## ✍️ 4. UX Writing Best Practices for LingoLens

- **Be Encouraging:** Use phrases like "Great job!", "You're getting there!", "Keep it up!"
- **Keep it Simple:** Avoid technical jargon. Instead of "Executing OCR Algorithm," use "Reading text..."
- **Bilingual Clarity:** For Arabic users, ensure that the Arabic text is natural and culturally appropriate, not just a literal translation.
- **Action-Oriented:** Use verbs in buttons (e.g., "Start Quiz," "Save Word," "Translate Now").
- **Gamified Feedback:** Use haptics and subtle animations for successful actions (like swiping a card correctly).
